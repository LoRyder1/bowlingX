**Encapsulation**

 - a mechanism for restricting access to some of the objects components

 Hiding the internals of the object protects its integrity by preventing users from setting the internal data of the component into an invalid or inconsistent state. 
  - a benefit of encapsulation is that it can reduce system complexity, and thus increase robustness, by allowing the limitation fo inter-dependencies between different components
